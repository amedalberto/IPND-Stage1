				<h2>CSS in General</h2>
				<p>With CSS you control the styles or presentation of a webpage. HTML should be use only for structure. There are three methods on adding CSS to your page. Method 1 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">External CSS</span>, where you add an external sheet with your CSS code to the head section of your html via a link element. Method 2 is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Internal CSS</span>, where you add your CSS code to the head element of your web page under the style element. And finally you can add <span style="font-weight:bold:">Inline CSS</span> to directly to each element on your web page. However, <span style="font-weight:bold:">Inline CSS</span> is not recommended due to code repetition.

				<h2>Flexbox</h2>
				<p>Flexbox is a new model of CSS which can be use to position boxes in your webpage. However, in order to support Safari you need to add the prefix -webkit.
